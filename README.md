This project is a clone of the Amazon website based on Next.js (React) and Firebase.  This project based on the wonderful tutorial by Clever Programmer @ YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDV3Z1KCBvo) with CSS/routing/adaptation to the Next.js framework by me.  Special features include fully functional payment processing with Stripe, adaptation to the Next.js framework's router (as opposed to the old React Router DOM), firebase authentication, and modular CSS across components.
